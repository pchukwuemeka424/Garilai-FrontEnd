# Ai-Researcher-paper-Writer-

AI-powered academic research and paper writing platform built for Nigerian students and lecturers. Combines agentic AI workflows, real-time literature retrieval, and citation-verified writing in a governed university-grade platform.

## Overview

**GARIL AI** (Governed AI for Research, Instruction and Learning) helps students and lecturers with every stage of academic research:

- Research idea generation and evaluation
- Structured research outline creation (grounded in real papers)
- Full research paper drafting with citation verification
- Literature reviews, thesis proposals, and study comparisons
- Lecture planning and course preparation
- Saved sessions and long-term research memory

Built for universities, colleges, polytechnics, and individual lecturers across Nigeria and beyond.

## How the Agentic AI Works

The platform is built around a stateful `ChatService` that orchestrates AI, tools, and data sources in a multi-step loop. Here is the pipeline for every research interaction:

```
User Message
     │
     ▼
1. Session Management
   └─ Creates or resumes a MongoDB session with a workflow-specific system prompt

     │
     ▼
2. Literature Retrieval (Automatic)
   └─ If the workflow requires it, the agent fetches real papers BEFORE calling the LLM:
      ├─ AlphaXiv  → searches recent academic preprints
      ├─ arXiv     → fallback export API for older literature
      └─ Tavily    → web search fallback when databases return no results

     │
     ▼
3. Context Injection
   └─ Retrieved paper abstracts and metadata are injected into the system prompt
      so the LLM writes grounded, source-backed responses only

     │
     ▼
4. LLM Streaming (OpenRouter)
   └─ Sends the enriched conversation history to the model
   └─ Streams token deltas in real-time over WebSocket to the frontend

     │
     ▼
5. Post-Processing
   ├─ Research paper references formatted and cleaned
   ├─ Full paper auto-saved to MongoDB (SavedResearch)
   └─ Token usage tracked and deducted from student quota

     │
     ▼
6. Agent Events (WebSocket)
   └─ Every phase emits typed events the frontend listens to:
      agent_start → tool_execution_start → tool_execution_end
      → message_update (delta) → message_end → token_usage → agent_end
```

All responses are non-hallucinated: the LLM is only permitted to cite papers that were fetched and injected at step 2.

## Research Workflows

Workflows are Markdown prompt files in `backend/prompts/`. Each defines a structured agentic protocol the AI follows step by step. The following workflows are available:

| Workflow | Command | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Research Paper | `/chat-paper` | Full paper draft with inline citations |
| Deep Research | `/deepresearch` | Multi-step investigation: plan → gather evidence → draft → cite → review → deliver |
| Literature Review | `/lit` | AI-synthesized review grounded in retrieved papers |
| Draft | `/draft` | Structured paper section drafting |
| Compare | `/compare` | Side-by-side study comparison with citations |
| Summarize | `/summarize` | Concise summary of a topic or paper |
| Review | `/review` | Critical academic review of existing work |
| Audit | `/audit` | Citation and source integrity audit |
| Auto Research | `/autoresearch` | Autonomous experiment loop: try → measure → keep → repeat |
| Watch | `/watch` | Monitor a topic for new developments |
| Log | `/log` | Session journaling and structured note-taking |
| Replicate | `/replicate` | Attempt to reproduce research findings |
| Recipe | `/recipe` | Step-by-step research methodology builder |
| Jobs | `/jobs` | Background task tracking |

### Deep Research Workflow in Detail

The `/deepresearch` workflow is the most advanced. It runs a 7-step agentic pipeline:

1. **Plan** — Creates a structured plan artifact with key questions, evidence needed, and a task ledger. Asks the user to confirm before proceeding.
2. **Scale** — Decides whether to use direct search (simple questions) or spawn parallel researcher subagents (broad, multi-faceted topics).
3. **Gather Evidence** — Searches using `web_search`, `fetch_content`, and paper databases. Researcher subagents run concurrently when used.
4. **Draft** — Synthesises all evidence into a structured report. No invented sources.
5. **Cite** — A verifier agent adds inline citations and verifies every URL.
6. **Review** — A reviewer agent checks for unsupported claims, logical gaps, and overconfident statements. FATAL issues are fixed before delivery.
7. **Deliver** — Final output and a provenance sidecar are written to `papers/<slug>.md` and `<slug>.provenance.md`.

## Outline Generation Pipeline

The outline generator runs its own agentic sub-pipeline before the LLM writes anything:

1. User provides: topic, discipline, research scope (undergraduate / masters / doctoral / faculty), and a selected research idea.
2. The system builds a combined search query from the topic, idea title, and discipline label.
3. Up to 8 real papers are fetched from AlphaXiv (with arXiv/Tavily fallback).
4. Paper abstracts are formatted and injected as context into the LLM prompt.
5. The LLM writes a structured Markdown outline grounded only in those papers.
6. ArXiv metadata (IDs, repository names, preprint labels) is stripped from the output.
7. A formatted "Sources for further reading" section is appended from the fetched paper list.

---

## Literature Sources

The platform builds each citation bank by querying multiple scholarly APIs in random order and interleaving their results (so references/in-text cites are not all from one source):

1. **AlphaXiv** — Recent academic preprints via the AlphaXiv public API.
2. **arXiv** — arXiv export API.
3. **OpenAlex** — Broad scholarly works index (API key optional).
4. **PubMed / NCBI** — Biomedical literature via E-utilities (API key optional).
5. **DOAJ** — Directory of Open Access Journals articles (no key).
6. **Europe PMC** — Biomedical abstracts and open full-text metadata (no key).
7. **Tavily** — Web-search fallback only when core databases under-fill the bank.

All sources are configurable via environment variables and can be individually disabled.

Research Type (scope) controls document structure, per-section in-text citation floors, word targets, and minimum distinct bank references (e.g. Assignment 12, Journal 25, Thesis 40, Dissertation 50).

```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=           # Required — your OpenRouter API key
MONGODB_URI=
PORT=3141
FEYNMAN_MODEL=openrouter/openai/gpt-5.1
AUTH_SECRET=change-me-in-production

# Optional: faster model for outline generation
# FEYNMAN_FAST_MODEL=openrouter/openai/gpt-4o-mini

# Optional: AlphaXiv paper search (enabled by default)
# ALPHAXIV_ENABLED=true
# ALPHAXIV_API_KEY=

# Optional: Tavily fallback search
# TAVILY_ENABLED=true
# TAVILY_API_KEY=

# Optional: Hugging Face Inference (rerank + fact-check)
# HF_TOKEN=
# HUGGINGFACE_ENABLED=true

# Optional: OpenAlex scholarly search
# OPENALEX_ENABLED=true
# OPENALEX_API_KEY=

# Optional: PubMed / NCBI E-utilities
# PUBMED_ENABLED=true
# PUBMED_API_KEY=
# NCBI_API_KEY=

# Optional: default admin account
# DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@aula.com
# DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123

## Deploy on a VPS

### Coolify — separate frontend + backend (recommended)

Create **two** Coolify applications from this repo:

| App | Dockerfile | Port | Notes |
|-----|------------|------|--------|
| Backend | `deploy/backend/Dockerfile` | `3141` | Env: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `MONGODB_URI` · health `/api/health` |
| Frontend | `deploy/frontend/Dockerfile` | `80` | Build arg `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEYNMAN_BACKEND` = backend public URL · health `/healthz` |

See [deploy/README.md](deploy/README.md), [deploy/backend/README.md](deploy/backend/README.md), [deploy/frontend/README.md](deploy/frontend/README.md).

### Docker Compose (split)

```bash
cp deploy/backend/.env.example backend/.env
export NEXT_PUBLIC_FEYNMAN_BACKEND=http://localhost:3141
docker compose up -d --build
```

### All-in-one (single process)

```bash
cp deploy/backend/.env.example backend/.env
npm run deploy:build
sudo bash deploy/all-in-one/setup-vps.sh /var/www/garil-ai
```

---

## Notes

- `.env` and `backend/.env` are excluded from git.
- `node_modules`, `.next`, `backend/dist`, and `out` are excluded from git.
- The AI model is swappable via `FEYNMAN_MODEL` — any model on OpenRouter works.
- Student users have token quotas managed by the admin panel.
